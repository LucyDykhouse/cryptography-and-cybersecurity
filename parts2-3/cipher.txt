The cipher I created is as follows:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 , . ? ! '
W E L C O M T H S , A P I ! D U N Y F R V B Q . ' K G J X 1 0 2 4 6 5 3 ? 9 7 Z 8

I created this cipher using the SWAPI documentation that I had open from yesterday's lab. The first instance of every alphabet letter or common character is recorded in the order that they appear on the website.
For instance, the first word in the documentation is 'Welcome,' so the first 6 letters of the cipher are the first instances of w, e, l, c, o, and m.
